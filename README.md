#### NEW: Google colab hebrew_wispher.ipynb added


## Installation steps

It's recommended to install in a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies efficiently.

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ShmuelRonen/hebrew_whisper.git
cd hebrew_whisper
```

### NEW - One click installer and executor:

```
Double click on:

```

### Manual installation:

It's recommended to create and activate a virtual environment here:
```

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

For PyTorch with CUDA 11.8 support, use the following command
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118ilE.md
```


After the installation, you can run the app by navigating to the directory containing `app.py` and executing:
```

python app.py
```


This will start a Gradio interface locally, which you can access through the provided URL in your command line interface.


### Docker installation:

Build image command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ShmuelRonen/hebrew_whisper.git
cd hebrew_whisper
docker build -t hebrew_whisper:latest .
```

Run a docker container:
```
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -p 7860:7860 -e IS_SHARE_LINK=True --name hebrew_whisper hebrew_whisper:latest
```

Open one of the the links:  
For local URL:  
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860  

For public URL, please replace the {generated_number} with the one you got in the command line.  
Running on public URL: [https://{generated_number}.gradio.live](https://{generated_number}.gradio.live)


## How to Use
Once the application is running, follow these steps:
1. Upload your audio file through the Gradio interface.
2. Select the source language of your audio file.
3. Click submit to start the transcription and translation process.
4. The transcribed and translated text will be displayed in the textbox, and a text file containing the output will be saved in the specified output directory.

## Features
- Supports unlimited length audio files.
- Splits transcribed text into well-structured paragraphs.
- Deletes temporary files automatically, leaving a clean workspace.
- Uses CUDA for accelerated processing if available.
